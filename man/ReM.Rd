ReM(
  X,
  Y,
  n_1,
  p_accept = 0.1,
  threshold = NULL,
  max_tries = 10000,
  seed = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numerical matrix; covariate matrix with n rows (units) and K columns (covariates). n >= 2 and K >= 1.}

\item{Y}{Numerical matrix; potential outcomes matrix with n rows and 2 columns (Y(0), Y(1)).}

\item{n_1}{Integer scalar; number of units to assign to treatment. n_1 > 0 and n_1 < nrow(X).}

\item{p_accept}{Numeric scalar; acceptance probability in (0, 1], default is 0.1.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric scalar; threshold for Mahalanobis distance. If NULL, it is computed from p_accept. Default is NULL. If provided, p_accept will be ignored.}

\item{max_tries}{Integer scalar; maximum number of random draws before giving up, default is 10000.}

\item{seed}{Integer scalar; optional random seed for reproducibility, default is NULL.}

\item{engine}{Character scalar; computation engine to use, either "R" or "cpp". Default is "cpp".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{Z}{Numeric vector; accepted treatment assignment with length n and values 0 (control) or 1 (treatment).}
\item{Y_obs}{Numeric vector; observed outcomes corresponding to the accepted assignment.}
\item{tries}{Integer scalar; number of random draws made until acceptance.}
\item{M}{Numeric scalar; Mahalanobis dsistance of the accepted assignment.}
\item{threshold}{Numeric scalar; threshold Mahalanobis distance used for acceptance.}
\item{p_accept}{Numeric scalar; acceptance probability used.}
\item{accepted}{Logical scalar; indicates whether an acceptable assignment was found within max_tries.}
\item{engine}{Character scalar; computation engine used ("R" or "cpp").}
}
}
\description{
Provides high-performance tools for rerandomization in randomized
experiments, including Mahalanobis-distance-based acceptance rules,
efficient generation of treatment assignments, and covariate-balance
diagnostics. Core algorithms are implemented in Rcpp and
RcppArmadillo for computational efficiency.

This function implements a rerandomization design based on Mahalanobis distance.
